# PortfolioProjects

Hello! My name is Michael Austin and I'm a Data Analyst with skills in Excel, SQL, Tableau, R, and SPSS. I have my Master's Degree in a somewhat related field - Psychological Science, where I worked primarily on designing experiments (usually involving learning and cognition), collecting data, analyzing it, and presenting it (through conferences or written articles). The most fascinating part of the whole process for me was always being able to handle the data. I loved working with code to manipulate data and see trends more clearly, and then an added bonus was being able to use that data to communicate stories about how people learned and remembered things. I'm excited to take that passion for working with data to pivot more directly into the world of Data Analytics!

This repository serves as a storage place for my Data Analysis projects. Please Enjoy!
