# PortfolioProjects

Hello! My name is Michael Austin and I'm a Data Analyst with skills in Excel, SQL, Tableau, and R. I have my Master's Degree in a somewhat related field - Psychological Science, where I worked primarily on designing experiments (usually involving learning and cognition), collecting data, analyzing it, and presenting it (through conferences or written articles). The most facinating part of the whole process for me was always being able to handle the data. I loved working with code to manipulate data and see trends more clearly, and then an added bonus was being able to use that data to communicate stories about how people learned and remembered things. I'm excited to take that passion for working with data to pivot more directly into the world of Data Analytics!

This repository serves as a storage place for my Data Analysis projects. Currently, I've completed 1 project revolving around the analysis
and visualization of Bikeshare data using R as part of the Google Analytics Certificate. In addition to the code here, a more complete summary can be viewed at:

A second project is actively underway examining and cleaning COVID data using SQL. More to come!
