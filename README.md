Hello! 

This repository serves as a storage place for my Data Analysis projects. Currently, I've completed a project analyzing and visualizing Bikeshare data using R as part of the Google Analytics Certificate. In addition to the code here, a more complete summary can be viewed at:

Additionally, I've included some of the code I created in SPSS to clean and analyze experimental data from my Master's Thesis project a few years ago.

And another project is actively underway examining and cleaning COVID data using SQL. More to come!
